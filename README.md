# UNDER WORK
This library is currently under work and it is in it's very early stages, I have made this repo public to just show the progress of making it, it is supposed to help download and plot meteorological data easily and more user-friendly than 
other existing frameworks.

# TODO
- ~~Add Functionality for GEM Model~~
- Add ECMWF Model
- Create documentation for adding models and making it a simpler process
- Adding a size estimation for the download files and ~~a progressbar~~
